Leonard with two violations of the

goes to Penny, who invites him to a

Bernadette, which Sheldon agrees to
after Penny mentions that they may be
talking trash about Priya. After the

to take Sheldon dancing, which Sheldon
reluctantly goes along with. After
dancing, Sheldon takes an intoxicated
Amy back to her apartment and as well as
talking about Priya, meets a monkey who
is addicted to smoking cigarettes. Amy

the office is not what he'd hoped for:
the thermostat is located in the office

the San Francisco Police Department
because of his obsessive/compulsive
disorder, Monk is working as a private
consultant investigating the murder of a
young woman named Nicole Vasquez.
Shortly after determining that the
murderer was at least 6'3"", smoked
menthol cigarettes, and wore slippers,
Monk receives a call from his former
boss, Captain Stottlemeyer, who
reluctantly requests his aid in
discovering the would-be assassin of
mayoral candidate Warren St. Claire.
While at least three people (including
Mrs. St. Claire) seem to have sufficient
motive to kill the candidate, the
Vasquez murder seems to be unmotivated.
Despite the captain's skepticism, Monk
is certain that the cases are related.
The police get a lead on the would-be
assassin, but he manages to escape, in
part because of Monk's fear of heights.
Sharona convinces the deputy mayor to
let Monk continue his investigation
despite Captain Stottlemeyer's
objections. After Monk has gathered the
suspects together to recreate the crime
scene, the hitman takes a shot at his
accomplice and Sharona, playing Lois
Lane, follows him into a sewer.
Overcoming his revulsion, Monk goes in
after them, placing Kleenex on the rungs
of the ladder to protect his hands and
feet on the way down. But Kleenex won't
protect his shoes or the cuffs of his
pants from the filthy, six-inch deep
water. This novel act of courage moves
Monk one step closer to recovering his

Natalie becomes a candidate in the
upcoming school board election despite
Monk's fears that she'll desert him if

Suspicion falls on Natalie's opponent in
