gay monkey, Dunham’s puppets have dirty

a fascinating entertainer, and anyone

Shaffer was adapted by the author into
this stylish film from director Joseph
L. Manciewicz. Laurence Olivier stars as
Andrew Wyke, a best-selling author of
detective fiction living in a grand 16th
century mansion. Andrew is visited by
Milo Tindle (Michael Caine), owner of a
hair salon chain, and reveals to his
guest that he's aware of Milo's affair
with his wife Marguerite. Rather than
being vengeful, however, Andrew
professes he's glad to be rid of his
troublesome spouse. To avoid paying
heavy alimony, Andrew suggests that Milo
disguise himself as a clown and steal
his wife's expensive jewelry. That way
Marguerite and Milo can obtain financial
security while Andrew claims the loss on
his insurance and all walk away rich.
Andrew's plan is a devious one, however,
designed to toy with his wife's lover,
and a series of deceptions and counter-
deceptions are launched in which nothing
is as it seems.","Thriller - Mystery","N/A","N/A","If it was murder, where's the body?","1972-12-10","Anthony Shaffer","United Kingdom","2:18:15","Joseph L. Mankiewicz","Laurence Olivier - Michael Caine - Alec
